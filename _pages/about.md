I’m Yunjing “Margaret” Wang, a physics and astronomy major at Haverford College, with a passion for cosmology and dark matter research. My work involves experimental and computational research in galaxy classification, dark matter detection, and the calibration of liquid xenon detectors for the DARWIN experiment. I’m also a recipient of the ThinkSwiss scholarship and the Velay Fellowship. Currently, I’m focused on validating electron drift in liquid xenon for Xenoscope at the University of Zurich. I aim to contribute to our understanding of the universe.
